# About

restrap is a tool designed to enchance Roblox by providing features not currently available in the client.

restrap is available for Windows only.

**The only official downloads for restrap are this repository and the** [website](https://sites.google.com/view/restrap-roblox).\
**Any other website is not owned by me and can potentially be malware.**

# Installing

You can get restrap from [releases](https://github.com/itstheguy4873/restrap/releases).

If your antivirus software flags restrap as malicious, it doesn't mean anything. It just does this because it doesn't recognize restrap.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/itstheguy4873/restrap/issues).
