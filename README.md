# About

restrap is a tool designed to enchance Roblox by providing features not currently available in the client.
restrap is available for Windows only. I am not planning on adding support for other OSes.

**The only official downloads for restrap are this repository and the** [website](https://sites.google.com/view/restrap-roblox).

# Downloading

You can get restrap from [releases](https://github.com/itstheguy4873/restrap/releases).

If your antivirus software flags restrap as malicious, there is no need to worry.
It does this because it doesn't recognize it. If you are still concerned, the  source code is available for viewing.
